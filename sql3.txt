(empID int,
empName varchar(30),
empAge int,
DepartmentId int,
salaryID int);

Department have these columns
(DepartmentID int,
DepartName varchar(30));

Solution:

create database CompanyDetails;
use CompanyDetails;

create table employee
(
empId int,
empName varchar(30),
empAge int,
DepId int,
SalaryId int);

insert into employee values('1','Anu','22','11','101')
insert into employee values('2','banu','23','12','102')
insert into employee values('3','santosh','24','13','103')
insert into employee values('4','john','25','14','104')
insert into employee values('5','jeevan','26','15','105')
insert into employee values('6','harry','27','16','106')
insert into employee values('7','stefan','30','18','110')

select * from employee

create table Department
(
DepId int,
DepName varchar(30)
);

insert into Department values('11','Dev')
insert into Department values('12','Testing')
insert into Department values('13','hr')
insert into Department values('14','support')
insert into Department values('15','risk analyst')
insert into Department values('16','devops')
insert into Department values('18','sql')

select * from Department

create table Salary
(
SalaryId int,
SalaryAmount int);

insert into Salary values('101','9000')
insert into Salary values('102','11000')
insert into Salary values('103','10000')
insert into Salary values('104','50000')
insert into Salary values('105','35000')
insert into Salary values('106','20000')
insert into Salary values('110','70000')

select * from Salary

select empName,DepName,SalaryAmount
from employee
join Department
on employee.DepId=Department.DepId
join salary
on salary.SalaryId=employee.SalaryId
